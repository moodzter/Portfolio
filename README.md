Personal website with important things about myself like my bio, my resume, and my personal projects!
This project was very fun. Css has always been my weak point, and it definitely was going into this but I feel like I've gotten better since I started. 
The hardest part was fitting it to mobile. I kept using px as my values because that was the only thing I knew but I learned (eventually) that percentages
are much better to use, because it is proportionate to the screen. 

I spent so much time trying to make my projects tab fit according to the size of the screen but it just simply did not work. It took a lot of trial 
and error before It finally started to look good. 
I spent too much time on that so I wasn't able to make some super cool unique jquery events, but I do have 3 of them. 

The first jquery event is my drop down menu, and it is very easy to make. There are slide down and slide up methods in jquery that you can use, 
and if you make a sub ul on a li element of the list before, and then make it hidden in css, you can make it shown by doing slide down then slide up jquery

My second one is my snowboard animation, I have a button that when you click, an animation of a snowboarder will go across the screen. 
I did something similar in my landscaping project, but I didn't understand it, I just found something and rolled with it. 
But now I would say I know how it works. When you say to animate something, you are simply changing some css value, but you're doing it very slowly
so in my code I made the img and the div that it's running across, then I put .animate onto it, and I simply said marginLeft: 75%. So, it will go 75%
across the span of the screen, and I have a huge value of 20000 so it will do it slowly. 

my third one are my description buttons on my projects. The projects are very simple so there is not a lot to explain, and this was heavily inspired by 
carolina, but she had a great idea. when I click the button, it created and appends text onto the div that the img is inside. very simple. 

Overall the project was very fun and I learned a lot of css, and a few more things about Jquery. I also learned a LOT more about how to format your 
html docs, I didn't think it was that important but it truly is. I don't think I managed my time very well though, I wish I put more time and effort into 
it so that I could have output some more complicated jquery events, but overall I don't think I did a bad job.
