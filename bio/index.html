            <h2>My Family</h2>
                <p class = "text">I wanted to start by talking a little bit about my family. Without my family I obviously wouldn't be here, but it's their willingness to push me and help me forward that makes me eternally grateful to them. No matter where we were in life my parents have always been willing to help me and my siblings pursue our interests in life. They also taught us the value of hard work, and putting our all into something that we love. I also like to include my two friends Taya and Ashton whenever I talk about family, because they've truly become as close as siblings. My brother and I grew up playing video games together, and without him I don't think I would know anything about computers and probably would've never started down the software path. I say this because the whole rest of my family are the most un-tech savvy people you will ever meet. So I'm also very grateful to him for that. </p>

            <h2>Why I'm Interested in Software</h2>
                <p class="text">I'm interested in software for several reasons. Growing up, I've always loved solving these little puzzle challenges whether it be an actual puzzle, some obstacle in a videogame, or a difficult problem to solve during my past work experience. I think I'm good at solving problems, because I always get this almost competitive attitude, that I NEED to complete or finish this thing, no matter what it takes. I chose software because I heard from friends about how they compared it to puzzles, and after researching it myself I could tell that this was something I could be really good at, and that I would enjoy immensely. Better yet I'd be able to support myself while working remotely. During quarantine thousands of companies had to go remote, and after talking with family members and friends it seemed like those companies that went remote started being more productive, surprising as that is. I would love to work remote while doing something I love, and I believe that's the main reason I chose Software as my career choice.</p>

            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
                <p class="text">I have a couple hobbies, but I mainly love to snowboard and golf. I've always tried to rank the two and I always go back and forth, so they're now at the same spot. I've been snowboarding since I was little, and living in Washington there are plenty of places to snowboard. My grandpa used to be a pro golfer, and my dad never went pro but he was really good in college. They both played a lot with me when I was young, and now it's definitely an important part of me. My dad and I go a lot, and we have a yearly trip where we go golfing for a week straight with a lot of our family friends. We play around 54 holes of golf a day, which is nuts. Those two are the most important to mention, but I love video games, and watching tv shows with friends or family. I don't really watch tv by myself, but I love to watch it with friends and family.</p>
